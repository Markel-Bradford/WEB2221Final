    <i>Super Smash bros. Melee</i> for the Nintendo GameCube.</h1>
    <article>
    <h2>The History</h2>
    <p id="gameplay"><i>Super Smash Bros. Melee</i> for the Nintendo GameCube, released in North America
    in December 2001, is the 2nd installment in the Smash Bros. franchise. 
    The game broke barriers with its evolution of the series' different approach 
    to platform fighting games by altering the way that damage is calculated and
    its unique win condition for matches unseen in the fighting game community. 
    Instead of depleting a health bar, you build percentage to knock your 
    opponent out of the screen four times. The game has seen been featured
    as a headliner at several prestigous events including the EVO tournament,
    the Genesis tournament series, and the CEO tournament series.

    <h2>The Gameplay</h2>
    <p><i>Super Smash Bros. Melee</i> boasts high speed gameplay with a high degree
    of freedom that keeps the players and fanbase engaged and active almost 23
    years after the games release. There is no limit to the number of
    combos that a player can perform or create due to the unique mechanics
    that the game possesses. What makes the gamplay unique is the unintentional 
    mecahnics that were discovered by players in 2006 including wave dashing,
    a movememnt mechanic that allows swifter moving across the stage, L-canceling,
    a mechanic that reduces lag time when landing on the ground following an attack,
    and shield dropping, a mechanic that allows defensive movement on platforms.

    <h2>The Community</h2>
    <p>The community for <i>Super Smash Bros. Melee</i> is what would be considered a grassroots
    community due to the players and fanbase being the largest part of the support for the 
    competitive scene. The community does not receive very much backing through sponsorships,
    yet is still able to host events and incentivize tournaments through voluntary donations,
    stream support, and dedicated event organizers. Where many fighting games have fallen
    to the way side as they aged, <i>Super Smash Bros. Melee</i>'s community refuses to let the game
    become a piece of history simply because of their love for the game. The community has 
    even gone as far as creating an online platform named Slippi that uses rollback netcode to allow players to
    compete in a more modern setting using their computer with a reduced lag, regardless of distance.
    Needless to say, with the support that the community brings, <i>Super Smash Bros. Melee</i> will continue to
    thrive for many years to come.

    <h2>The Competition</h2>
    <p>There is a very strong competitive scene for <i>Super Smash Bros. Melee</i> with over 50 large tournamnet 
    series that occur throught the year. These tournamnets are considered majors, or super majors depending on the 
    number of top 10 power ranked players in attendance. These tournaments offer large prize pools that pay out a
    percentage based on placement to the top 12 placing individuals. The highest ever prize pool was $155,372 with a 
    1st place payout of $46,6111.60. With numbers like this being within the realm of possibility, it makes sense that
    players would look to claim their chance to compete for a shot at the grand prize 
    <br><br>
    There are also local and regional tournaments that happen every week accross the united states that players
    attend in an effort to become the best in their respective area and gain practice for the big stage. The 
    power rankings are volatile and there is always someone new that rises the ranks and breaks into the top 10.
    This serves as a great motivator and reminded that with practice, effort, and attendance to these smaller tournaments,
    anyone has the opportunity to take the throne!
